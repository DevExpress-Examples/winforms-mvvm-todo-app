# A Sample DevExpress WinForms MVVM Application

This repository includes a sample WinForms application built with [DevExpress MVVM Framework](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/113955/build-an-application/winforms-mvvm). The app contains the following modules:

* A welcome screen
* Main application form that shows other application modules (screens) as pages inside its NavigationFrame control
* The "Items" screen that shows a check-list of to-do items
* The "Edit item" screen that allows users to edit individual to-do items

This application demonstrates the following DevExpress MVVM Framework concepts:

* Property and data bindings
* Command bindings
* Services
* Messenger

The **MVVM Best Practices** demo includes a module with a step-by-step guide on how to create this application.
